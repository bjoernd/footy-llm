# Timestamp Update for Prompt Plan

For all prompts in the prompt_plan.md file, update the checklist update instructions to include timestamps. Replace the existing instruction:

```
After completing each commit, update the implementation checklist in specs/todo.md:
- Mark completed tasks as [x] instead of [ ]
- Add any additional tasks discovered during implementation
- Commit the updated checklist with a message like "Update implementation checklist"
```

With this updated instruction:

```
After completing each commit, update the implementation checklist in specs/todo.md:
- Mark completed tasks as [x] instead of [ ] and add the completion timestamp in format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
  Example: "[x] Initialize Git repository (2025-04-10 21:15:30)"
- Add any additional tasks discovered during implementation
- Commit the updated checklist with a message like "Update implementation checklist"
```

This change should be applied to all prompts in the prompt_plan.md file to ensure consistent tracking of task completion times.

# Additional testing

Before any git commit that you create, run a build with `hatch build` and a test with `hatch run test`. Only proceed if the tests succeed 100%.

Format the code using the black code formatter before submitting a commit.
