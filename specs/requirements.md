# Football Match Notification Service Specification

## Project Overview
A service that monitors football matches for specific teams and sends notifications for key events during those matches. The service will automatically detect upcoming matches, poll for live updates during games, and deliver notifications through existing messaging channels.

## Teams of Interest
- Dynamo Dresden (German 3rd Liga)
- Forres Mechanics FC (Scottish Highland League)

## Core Features

### Match Detection and Monitoring
- Automatically detect scheduled matches for configured teams
- Send notification when a new upcoming match is detected within 3 days
- Send notification at the start of a match
- Poll for match updates once per minute during active matches
- Implement retry mechanism with backoff strategy for API connectivity issues

### Event Notifications
- **Match events that trigger notifications:**
  - Match start
  - Goals
  - Half-time score
  - Match end
- Include detailed match statistics when available

### Notification Delivery
- Support for notification delivery via:
  - Signal messages
  - SMS
  - Email
- Prioritize cost-effective delivery methods

### Configuration
- Use a plain text configuration file for settings
- Allow configuration of:
  - Teams to monitor
  - Notification preferences
  - Contact information for notifications

### Logging and History
- Maintain logs of all detected events
- Store history of match events and notifications
- Logs stored locally on the host only (no external access)

## Technical Specifications

### Implementation
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Hosting Options:**
  - Digital Ocean droplet
  - Raspberry Pi

### Data Source
- Start with free football data API options:
  - Football-Data.org (primary consideration)
  - Explore public RSS feeds or free data sources specific to target leagues
- Design with flexibility to switch to paid APIs in the future if needed:
  - API-Football (RapidAPI)
  - SportMonks

### System Architecture
1. **Scheduler Component**
   - Checks for upcoming matches daily
   - Manages polling frequency (once per minute during matches, less frequently otherwise)

2. **API Integration Component**
   - Handles communication with football data API
   - Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Parses and normalizes data from API responses

3. **Event Detection Component**
   - Compares current match state with previous state
   - Identifies notable events (goals, match start/end, etc.)
   - Extracts match statistics

4. **Notification Component**
   - Formats event information into readable messages
   - Delivers notifications through configured channels
   - Handles delivery failures

5. **Logging Component**
   - Records all system activities
   - Maintains history of match events
   - Stores notification delivery status

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Setup
- Set up basic project structure
- Implement configuration file handling
- Establish logging framework

### Phase 2: API Integration
- Integrate with free football data API
- Implement match schedule detection
- Set up polling mechanism with retry logic

### Phase 3: Event Detection
- Develop logic to identify key match events
- Implement match statistics collection
- Create event history storage

### Phase 4: Notification System
- Implement notification formatting
- Set up delivery through preferred channels
- Add notification for upcoming matches

### Phase 5: Testing and Refinement
- Test with live matches
- Refine polling frequency and retry strategies
- Optimize notification content and timing

## Future Considerations
- Potential migration to paid APIs for better coverage
- Additional notification channels
- More customizable event triggers
- Web interface for configuration and match history
