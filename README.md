# Football Match Notification Service

A Python service that monitors football matches for specific teams and sends notifications for key events like goals, match start/end, and other important updates.

Plot twist: I am asking an LLM to implement it. See the prompts in the specs/ folder for how the conversations started. The whole process is inspired by two articles I read:
- https://harper.blog/2025/02/16/my-llm-codegen-workflow-atm/ where I copied the prompt and iterative approach from
- https://manuel.kiessling.net/2025/03/31/how-seasoned-developers-can-achieve-great-results-with-ai-coding-agents/ which taught me to make sure we use proper testing guardrails along the way
