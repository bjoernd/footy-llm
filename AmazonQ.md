# Football Match Notification Service - Amazon Q Implementation Notes

## Project Setup

The project has been set up with the following structure:

- `football_match_notification_service/`: Main package directory
- `tests/`: Directory for test files
- `pyproject.toml`: Project configuration for Hatch build system
- `.gitignore`: Git ignore file
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Git Repository

The Git repository has been initialized with the following commits:
1. Initial commit with README and .gitignore
2. Add project structure and pyproject.toml
3. Update implementation checklist
4. Add Amazon Q implementation notes
5. Add basic config_manager.py with file loading functionality
6. Add configuration validation logic
7. Implement access methods for configuration values
8. Add sample config.json with documentation
9. Write unit tests for the configuration manager
10. Update implementation checklist
11. Add basic logger setup with console output
12. Add custom log levels and structured logging
13. Fix structured logging and add logger tests
14. Update implementation checklist for logging system

## Configuration Management

The configuration management system has been implemented with the following features:

- JSON-based configuration file
- Validation of required configuration sections and fields
- Default values for optional configuration fields
- Access methods for retrieving configuration values
- Support for nested configuration using dot notation
- Configuration reloading at runtime
- Comprehensive unit tests

## Logging System

The logging system has been implemented with the following features:

- Console and file output options
- Log file rotation with configurable size and backup count
- Custom log levels for football match events (MATCH_START, MATCH_END, GOAL, etc.)
- Structured logging with JSON format
- Support for extra fields in log messages
- Comprehensive unit tests

## Next Steps

To complete the project setup:

1. Install Hatch:
   ```bash
   pip install hatch
   ```

2. Create and activate the Hatch environment:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bjoernd/src/bjoern-foot
   hatch env create
   hatch shell
   ```

3. Run the tests to verify the implementation:
   ```bash
   hatch run test
   ```

4. Next implementation task: API Integration

## Implementation Plan

The project will be implemented following the plan in `specs/prompt_plan.md`, with the following phases:

1. Foundation Setup ✓
   - Project Structure ✓
   - Configuration Management ✓
   - Logging System ✓
2. API Integration (next)
3. Scheduling and Event Detection
4. Notification System
5. Integration and Main Application

Progress is being tracked in `specs/todo.md`.
