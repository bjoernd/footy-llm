# Football Match Notification Service - Amazon Q Implementation Notes

## Project Setup

The project has been set up with the following structure:

- `football_match_notification_service/`: Main package directory
- `tests/`: Directory for test files
- `pyproject.toml`: Project configuration for Hatch build system
- `.gitignore`: Git ignore file
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Git Repository

The Git repository has been initialized with the following commits:
1. Initial commit with README and .gitignore
2. Add project structure and pyproject.toml
3. Update implementation checklist
4. Add Amazon Q implementation notes
5. Add basic config_manager.py with file loading functionality
6. Add configuration validation logic
7. Implement access methods for configuration values
8. Add sample config.json with documentation
9. Write unit tests for the configuration manager
10. Update implementation checklist

## Configuration Management

The configuration management system has been implemented with the following features:

- JSON-based configuration file
- Validation of required configuration sections and fields
- Default values for optional configuration fields
- Access methods for retrieving configuration values
- Support for nested configuration using dot notation
- Configuration reloading at runtime
- Comprehensive unit tests

## Next Steps

To complete the project setup:

1. Install Hatch:
   ```bash
   pip install hatch
   ```

2. Create and activate the Hatch environment:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bjoernd/src/bjoern-foot
   hatch env create
   hatch shell
   ```

3. Run the tests to verify the configuration manager:
   ```bash
   hatch run test
   ```

4. Next implementation task: Logging System

## Implementation Plan

The project will be implemented following the plan in `specs/prompt_plan.md`, with the following phases:

1. Foundation Setup (in progress)
   - Project Structure ✓
   - Configuration Management ✓
   - Logging System (next)
2. API Integration
3. Scheduling and Event Detection
4. Notification System
5. Integration and Main Application

Progress is being tracked in `specs/todo.md`.
